### SOFE4840U: Computer & Software Security

## Course Project: University Secure Payment and Financial Form Managing System

Group 6

-------------------------------------------

The aim of our proposed solution is to provide students with a secure system to perform school-related payments, while also being able to download and upload financial documents such as tax forms.
We will make use of several concepts such as RSA-AES cryptography and hashing to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these transactions are present.
