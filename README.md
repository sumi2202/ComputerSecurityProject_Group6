### SOFE4840U: Computer & Software Security

## Course Project: University Secure Payment and Financial Form Managing System

Group 6

-------------------------------------------

The aim of our proposed solution is to provide students with a secure system to perform school-related payments, while also being able to download and upload financial documents such as tax forms.
We will make use of several concepts such as RSA-AES cryptography and RC4 hashing to ensure that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of these transactions are present. 

### Running instructions

1. Install necessary libraries such as pycryptodome, PyPDF2, Flask SQLAlchemy, etc. You can do so through ```pip install {library}```.
2. Run init_db.py to initialize the database.
3. Run main.py.
4. The application will run on the following url: ```http://127.0.0.1:5000```.
